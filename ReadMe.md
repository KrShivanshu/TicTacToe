# TicTacToe Game
Made by Kumar Shivanshu


It is a game made using c++ and SFML(Simple and fast multimedia library). Is is a fun and very interactive game that a single player can play against AI (Computer). Main aim of doing this project was to know how AI works in games to make it more enjoyable and realistic.

**Tic-tac-toe**, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.

### Aim of making the project
* To understand how AI works in such games.
* To clear the understanding of how such game works.
* To learn graphics designing using SFML.
* To make use of my skills in c++.
* To see how Class and Objects are useful.

### Languages Used
* C++ - C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
* SFML - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a simple application programming interface to various multimedia components in computers. It is written in C++ with bindings available for C, Crystal, D, Euphoria, Go, Java, Julia,.NET, Nim, OCaml, Python, Ruby, and Rust.


### Data Structures Used
 * Linked List
 * Maps
 * Array

## How to use this
* ### Prerequisites 
   1. C++ Environment
   2. SFML Library
   3. Visual Studio
* ### Steps to follow to run it using VSCode Editor
   [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxKyUwpBmy4&list=PLRtjMdoYXLf4L0UVTggZdTV55baO6x6CO&index=2&t=184s)
* ### Use exe file
   You can also run the application using the .exe file located in Debug folder with name tictactoe.exe
   But first you need to clone/download the whole project to your computer (**Note-** While using .exe it should only be used inside Debug folder where all .dll files are kept and Assets folder should also be in same folder because Assets are grabbed during run time, it isn't included in .exe file)

## Possible Future Update
* Show message of who Won and match was ad draw 
* Add 2 players playing option
* Add sound for clicks and when match won/lose
* Make AI more intelligent
* Add difficulty level while playing AI
* Add some randomness in AI move for same move from players side
* give option to choose 'O' or 'X' for the player to play with
